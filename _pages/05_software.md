### A Personal Recommendation of **R**


I have been using **R** since I started my postgraduate study in Peking University in 2005. **R** helps me with my daily research and teaching.

**R** has many advantages.
First, it inherits the standard program syntax from **C**. It is quick to learn for anyone with prior programming experience. Moreover, once you master **R**, it is easy to switch to other chosen language, if not **R**, in your workplace in the future.

Second, backed by a vast statistician community, **R** enjoys a large selection of packages, including the most recent ones. Indeed, once they publish a paper,  statisticians often write and upload a companion package so that other researchers can adopt their methods.

Third, **R** is free.
It was the primary reason that I chose it at the very beginning.
In the era of open-source software, an algorithm written in **R** is much easier to share, test, and improve, since anyone can run the code on any platform, free of license and fee headache.

**R** is not without limitations. For example, speed is a concern when running big and complex jobs. However, it will not be an issue in the problems that we will encounter in the first year postgraduate study.
